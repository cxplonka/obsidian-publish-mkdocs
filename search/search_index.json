It is user friendly and allows very fast calculations. In this tutorial we focus on the explanations with gravity field modelling. The calculation of the magnetic field of geological bodies is equivalent: one replaces the rock parameter \"density\" by the rock parameter \"magnetic susceptibility\" or, where it is necessary, by the \"remanent magnetization\" of rocks. All explanations are valid for modelling with both fields. Gravity anomalies - i.e. deviations from the normal field or theoretical gravity field of the Earth, \\[\\Delta g = g_{measured} - \\gamma_{normal}\\] provide us with insights into the geological structure and related density distribution of a region. For a specific gravity anomaly, or, more realistically expressed, for an ensemble of anomalies to be explained, however, an infinite number of density distributions can theoretically cause these anomalies ( Fig. 1.1 ). {{< figure library=\"true\" src=\"gravity_nonuniqueness.png\" lightbox=\"true\" title=\" FIGURE 1.1: Non-uniqueness of gravity interpretations.

Without any other independent information (constraints) it cannot be concluded, which of the \\(\\rho_2\\) -bodies is responsible for the observed gravity anomaly. \" numbered=\"false\" id=\"gravity_nonuniqueness\" >}} Note the ambiguity of all potential field observations! It is essential to the modelling philosophy of IGMAS+ to overcome this ambiguity by means of gravity-independent observations (constraints). With this software package, Free Air , Bouguer - and geoid anomalies can be modelled (among others: G\u00f6tze and Lahmeyer, 1988 , Schmidt et al., 2011 , Schmidt et al., 2020 ). At the beginning of each modelling, the user should decide whether to work with Bouguer or Free Air anomalies : work with Free Air anomalies if no terrain and Bouguer slab corrections were calculated before and work with Bouguer anomalies if both corrections had been applied to measurements. This is an important decision, because the model must be built accordingly. IGMAS+ does not calculate one or the other anomaly, but the static part (attraction) of the gravity field of an Earth model, a sedimentary basin, a cavity or a mountain range which are represented as an ensemble of three-dimensional closed density bodies. For the following it will be agreed that the geophysical term \"Free Air anomaly\" is equivalent to the geodetic term \"Disturbance\". Free Air anomaly (disturbance in geodesy): \\( \\(FA = g_P - \\gamma + \\delta g_F\\) \\) Bouguer anomaly: \\( \\(BA = FA - \\delta g_B\\) \\) with: \\(g_P\\) -- observed/measured gravity value at station \\(P\\) \\(\\gamma\\) -- normal gravity at the ellipsoid \\(\\delta g_F\\) -- Free Air correction (normal gravity at station \\(P\\) ) \\(\\delta g_B\\) -- Bouguer mass correction (gravity effect of masses between the station \\(P\\) and the ellipsoid) The cartoon in Fig. 1.2 illustrates the diverse processing steps which are necessary to calculate gravity anomalies. {{< figure library=\"true\" src=\"gravity_cartoon.png\" lightbox=\"true\" title=\" FIGURE 1.2: This cartoon visualises the various steps required to compute a geophysical anomaly and the resulting changes in the processed gravity field.

The user should look more closely into these correction terms while using downloaded gravity fields from the ICGEM website . IGMAS+ allows users to fit measured gravity observations to 3D and 2D density models and interactively compare the calculated fields to the observed anomalies. We mention \"observed anomalies\" and by this mean that comparative values of the gravity fields can originate from two different sources: Specific processed field measurements, or Global models like those available on the ICGEM website . Please refer also to the notes in the chapter 4.6 . To obtain an interactively optimised fit between calculated and observed anomalies, users can: manually adjust a density configuration by changing the density values and the geometries of density bodies automatically invert a gravity field for a density configuration. In this workflow, gravity independent observations (such as geological maps, borehole information, seismic velocities and discontinuities, cross sections derived from other geological and geophysical interpretations, etc.) are integrated at two stages: when defining the density configuration of an initial 3D model and when interactively modifying the model while simultaneously visualising the independent constraints. Common to all inverse approaches, the number of the \"free\" parameters (degrees of freedom) in the modelling process should be significantly reduced before the final forward field matching, respectively inverse density calculation. For example, the final modelling step may be limited to the adjustment of the thickness and the lateral extent of a model unit with the pre-defined density (variation). Fixing as many other parameters of the initial 3D density model as possible requires the input data of appropriate spatial coverage and (in the best case) \"old familiar\" uncertainties. On the other hand, the model should be kept simple, in other words, one should choose complexity just to be able to answer a properly defined scientific question. Note also the different scales for the individual results of the gravity calculations. This procedure must be done by the user before modelling.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Tutorial/Setting%20up%20a%20model/","text":"For the modeller, each compilation of a density/susceptibility model always consists of two activities that result from a theoretical approach: a body must be defined which contains a mass/magnetic material (here density and/or susceptibility), and the distances from stations where the gravity and/or magnetic fields were measured. Therefore, model stations must be defined (see below). At first, the origin point of the model (its zero point) has to be fixed, which is not only the origin of model geometry, but also of model stations, of the corresponding gravity/magnetic fields which should be matched, of the voxel cube and of any available additional map information, for example from a geographical and/or a digitized geological map. We start with the explanation on how to handle the bodies and continue with the explanation for stations. Please use the Introduction 2.1 Model bodies \u00b6 In IGMAS+ , density in space can be defined either in terms of triangulated polyhedra surrounding a certain volume of constant density ( Fig. 2.1 ) or a 3D voxel cube ( Fig. 2.2 ) containing numerous voxels, each carrying its own density value. {{< figure library=\"true\" src=\"two_polyhedra_model.png\" lightbox=\"true\" title=\" FIGURE 2.1: A model with two polyhedra of constant densities (pink and red).\" numbered=\"false\" id=\"two_polyhedra_model\" >}} {{< figure library=\"true\" src=\"voxel_model.png\" lightbox=\"true\" title=\" FIGURE 2.2: A voxel model defining sedimentary density structures.\" numbered=\"false\" id=\"voxel_model\" >}} All polyhedra with the same density definition make up a model body (Body Manager), while a single model body may be divided into several geometrically separated polyhedra (called \" indexed body parts \"). The hull of a polyhedron is composed of interfaces. The geometry of each interface is defined by vertices. The user-defined positioning of these vertices is crucial for the triangulation process by which IGMAS+ geometrically approximates the 3D density structure. The obtained model topology is defined based on the position of such vertices on pre-defined, parallel oriented, vertical planes (vertical working sections ) ( Fig. 2.3 ). {{< figure library=\"true\" src=\"model_construction.png\" lightbox=\"true\" title=\" FIGURE 2.3: Illustration of basic terms for IGMAS+ model construction: vertices (black points), triangles (black lines), and working sections (vertical planes).\" numbered=\"false\" id=\"model_construction\" >}} These working sections are the virtual scenes for implementing any interactive modifications of model geometries, for example, by adding , deleting , or moving vertices . In case the model is built on working sections ( Fig. 2.3 ), there are no vertices located between the working sections. The user therefore should define the number, spacing and horizontal orientation (strike direction) of these working sections to keep sufficient control of model geometries throughout the interactive modelling process and to allow for a proper analysis of elongated gravity anomalies (i.e., orient working sections perpendicular to the strike of major anomalies). Working sections are always parallel ( Fig. 2.4 ). {{< figure library=\"true\" src=\"section_geometry.png\" lightbox=\"true\" title=\" FIGURE 2.4: Four steps that are important when defining the geometry of the model bodies by \u201csections\u201d.

(d) Consider which of the sections and the intersections are really important to model the anomaly correctly.\" numbered=\"false\" id=\"section_geometry\" >}} {{% callout note %}} Remember: The simpler the model - the better it is. {{% /callout %}} IGMAS+ calculates gravity effect either for a flat or a spherically curved model. The latter is required for very extensive model domains. To get an impression of the Earth surface \"depression\" of a spherical model compared to a flat one, note the following numbers: Distance [km] Depression [m] 10 7.85 50 196 100 784 200 ~3000 250 ~5000 In addition, it should be considered that in a spherical model the calculation of the direction of the vertical component changes continuously according to the curvature of the Earth because it always points to the centre of the Earth. Thereby, a spherical model assumes that the Earth is approximated by a sphere; an elliptical shape cannot yet be realized (but this is negligible for many lithosphere modelling applications). Test calculations have shown that for a model extending by, e.g., \\(2000 \\times 2000\\) km \\(^2\\) and reaching a depth of \\(200\\) km, there is a difference in calculated gravity between a spherical and flat modelling approach of about \\(20--25\\times 10^{-5}~~\\) m/s \\(^2~~\\) ( \\(20--25\\) mGal) . Depending on the user\u2019s objectives and the characteristics of gravity/magnetics independent information at hand, there are basically three different ways of building up an initial 3D density model ready to be analysed in terms of its gravity/magnetics effects: a) \u201cDefining sections\u201d approach: define working sections before loading or creating model vertices. b) \u201cLoading layers/interfaces/horizons\u201d approach: load point sets forming body interfaces before defining working sections. c) \u201cLoading a voxel cube\u201d after defining the model space according to (a) or (b) When selecting the \u201csections\u201d approach (a) , the user builds the model from scratch by first defining the 3D model extent and the vertical (working) sections and then loading or creating vertices to construct interfaces that separate bodies of different density. Any gravity-independent data which are loaded into the obtained model space to help constructing the density bodies (e.g., bitmaps, point sets) can be projected and visualised on the vertical sections. In this case, the sections should be appropriately positioned to keep the projection-related distortions of observed structures small. Since all vertical sections need to be parallel, it might not be possible to represent all available structural information ideally in the model domain. Hence, option (a) suits well to solve generic problems independent of correctly georeferenced structures. Additionally, the approach may be selected if the spatial coverage of gravity-independent structural input data (e.g. seismic profiles, boreholes) is very limited with respect to a larger number of observed gravity anomalies. For example, the interpreted structure of a single 2D seismic section could thus be continued laterally by inferring a variety of consistent 3D models from the observed gravity field. Thereby, one would strategically start with a simple density configuration and increase the model extent and complexity stepwise. If the spatial coverage of structural input data is dense enough and the depth/thickness configuration of several density bodies can be derived directly and modelled outside of IGMAS+ , then the \u201clayer\u201d approach (b) offers the proper functionality. In this case, the user can load continuous interfaces or horizons -- sets of regularly or irregularly spaced points with XYZ coordinates. Each horizon defines the top of a spatial domain that -- according to gravity-/magnetics-independent observations -- has been identified as a potential contrast in density with respect to adjacent domains. The loaded interfaces/horizons are stacked by IGMAS+ and collectively define the default 3D model extent (to be changed optionally), while the working sections are defined only after this stage. As part of the model building process, IGMAS+ interpolates between the loaded XYZ points of a horizon, derives the intersections of the horizon with the working sections and accordingly creates a number of vertices positioned on the latter. Hence, the initially loaded point sets are not identical with the final vertices representing a horizon! Care should be taken that the horizons / layers / interfaces do not intersect each other (corresponding to a negative thickness of the respective layer in between). Generally speaking, there are no specific suggestions for the use of case (a) or (b). Recently, there has been some preference for the use of case (b), since many modelers prefer to work with predefined layers from open databases (for example CRUST1.0 , LITHO1.0 , ETOPO1 and many others). Layers cannot be eliminated from the model afterwards. But you can assign the same density to the horizon as to its neighbouring horizons, to the side of it, above it or below it. Then it has no more gravity effect on the model stations. After setting up a model either following approach a) or b), one or several model bodies may be selected for \u201cvoxelization\u201d approach (c) , i.e., for being differentiated into numerous voxels, each carrying its own density value. In this way, smaller-scale density variations derived from independent observations (e.g., seismic, mineralogical-petrological) can be superimposed on the geological structure and considered for the gravity calculation. Each voxel is associated with an effective density representing the sum of: a constant body density and a voxel density. One way of defining the voxel density is to first create a voxel grid and then apply a certain function to implement physical laws or empirical concepts such as seismic-velocity-to-density conversions or depth-controlled porosity-density functions. Alternatively, the voxel cube may be defined completely by data import including both the coordinates and density values of the voxels. Additional IGMAS+ functionality related to voxel cubes is provided in terms of: multiplication of the voxel density with a voxel factor for fast model modifications, automatic edge effect minimization and transformation of voxel-related density variations into triangulated isosurfaces. Note that currently only one voxel cube can be applied to an IGMAS+ model. 2.2 Model densities \u00b6 Concerning the density value assigned to each model body, it does not matter if absolute or relative density values are chosen, since the resulting gravity effect only depends on the density differences at modelled interfaces and the distances from stations. This implies that gravity modelling alone cannot determine absolute values of densities. For a deeper understanding of these statements, a more detailed description of the basic mathematical-physical formulas for the calculation of the gravity effect in IGMAS+ would be beneficial. However, this would go beyond the scope of this tutorial. Therefore, the original publications by G\u00f6tze and Lahmeyer (1988) or by G\u00f6tze (2014) are recommended. 2.3 Model stations \u00b6 The observed and calculated gravity fields are defined at the stations, each being defined by its \\(XYZ\\) coordinates. The station height ( \\(Z\\) ) refers to its elevation with respect to the geoid, in case of elliptical coordinates -- also to the ellipsoid. It either represents the vertical position of the original gravimeter measurement (daylight surface for terrestrial data, height above the sea level for ship data, flight height for airborne and satellite data, etc.) or a reference level to which the acquired remote data have been continued (see chapter 4 and Fig. 4.1 , Fig. 4.2 and Fig. 4.3 ). The only condition that must be met for the height of all stations is that they must be located above all model masses. It has its meaning for modelling exclusively when using Free Air anomalies. Practical experience and examples for heights of the user-defined reference level ( Fig. 4.1 , Fig. 4.2 and Fig. 4.3 ) can be found here: Mountain range Top mountain Minimum height of the reference level (m) European Mittelgebirge (low mountain ranges) Brocken (Germany) 1500 Eastern Alps Gro\u00dfglockner (Austria) 5000 Western Alps Mont Blanc (Italy/France) 6000 Andes Aconcagua (Argentina) 7000 Himalayas Everest (Nepal/China) 8000 Note that to avoid numerical/theoretical problems (namely, local outliers in the calculated gravity), the stations should neither be located inside a model body nor precisely on its edges or surfaces (hence, check the \\(Z\\) values with respect to the top of the uppermost model body). In case of doubt, add \\(13\\) cm to the height of the body surface -- the height of the gravimeter measuring system (see Fig. 4.2 ). The spatial coverage and spacing of the stations (i.e. their \\(XY\\) coordinates), together with the wavelengths of the associated observed anomalies, provide limits to the scales and resolution of subsurface density heterogeneities that can be derived -- an important aspect when planning a gravity modelling project ( Fig. 2.4(b,c,d) ). In the context of resolution, IGMAS+ allows gravity calculations for a large number of stations -- but user should keep in mind the memory size limit (refer to the {{% staticref \"files/IGMAS_User_Manual.pdf\" %}} IGMAS+ User Manual {{% /staticref %}}, chapter 2.1.2). In general, there are two different types of station data that IGMAS+ users may use: irregularly or regularly spaced data. When working with original irregularly spaced measurements (i.e. scattered and clustered \\(XY\\) station coordinates), the observed and the modelled gravity have the same relative position with respect to the causative density bodies. If one chooses to interpret anomalies that have been transferred to a regular grid (e.g., by use of ICGEM data sets, chapter 4.6 , or other grids), however, one accepts that the model bodies have a smaller effect with respect to the stations than the real bodies due to interpolation procedures. Hence, it is generally recommended to use irregularly distributed stations instead of gridded gravity data.","title":"Setting up a model"},{"location":"Tutorial/Setting%20up%20a%20model/#21-model-bodies","text":"In IGMAS+ , density in space can be defined either in terms of triangulated polyhedra surrounding a certain volume of constant density ( Fig. 2.1 ) or a 3D voxel cube ( Fig. 2.2 ) containing numerous voxels, each carrying its own density value. {{< figure library=\"true\" src=\"two_polyhedra_model.png\" lightbox=\"true\" title=\" FIGURE 2.1: A model with two polyhedra of constant densities (pink and red).\" numbered=\"false\" id=\"two_polyhedra_model\" >}} {{< figure library=\"true\" src=\"voxel_model.png\" lightbox=\"true\" title=\" FIGURE 2.2: A voxel model defining sedimentary density structures.\" numbered=\"false\" id=\"voxel_model\" >}} All polyhedra with the same density definition make up a model body (Body Manager), while a single model body may be divided into several geometrically separated polyhedra (called \" indexed body parts \").

Each voxel is associated with an effective density representing the sum of: a constant body density and a voxel density. One way of defining the voxel density is to first create a voxel grid and then apply a certain function to implement physical laws or empirical concepts such as seismic-velocity-to-density conversions or depth-controlled porosity-density functions. Alternatively, the voxel cube may be defined completely by data import including both the coordinates and density values of the voxels. Additional IGMAS+ functionality related to voxel cubes is provided in terms of: multiplication of the voxel density with a voxel factor for fast model modifications, automatic edge effect minimization and transformation of voxel-related density variations into triangulated isosurfaces. Note that currently only one voxel cube can be applied to an IGMAS+ model.","title":"2.1 Model bodies"},{"location":"Tutorial/Setting%20up%20a%20model/#22-model-densities","text":"Concerning the density value assigned to each model body, it does not matter if absolute or relative density values are chosen, since the resulting gravity effect only depends on the density differences at modelled interfaces and the distances from stations. This implies that gravity modelling alone cannot determine absolute values of densities. For a deeper understanding of these statements, a more detailed description of the basic mathematical-physical formulas for the calculation of the gravity effect in IGMAS+ would be beneficial. However, this would go beyond the scope of this tutorial. Therefore, the original publications by G\u00f6tze and Lahmeyer (1988) or by G\u00f6tze (2014) are recommended.","title":"2.2 Model densities"},{"location":"Tutorial/Setting%20up%20a%20model/#23-model-stations","text":"The observed and calculated gravity fields are defined at the stations, each being defined by its \\(XYZ\\) coordinates. The station height ( \\(Z\\) ) refers to its elevation with respect to the geoid, in case of elliptical coordinates -- also to the ellipsoid. It either represents the vertical position of the original gravimeter measurement (daylight surface for terrestrial data, height above the sea level for ship data, flight height for airborne and satellite data, etc.) or a reference level to which the acquired remote data have been continued (see chapter 4 and Fig. 4.1 , Fig. 4.2 and Fig. 4.3 ). The only condition that must be met for the height of all stations is that they must be located above all model masses. It has its meaning for modelling exclusively when using Free Air anomalies. Practical experience and examples for heights of the user-defined reference level ( Fig. 4.1 , Fig. 4.2 and Fig. 4.3 ) can be found here: Mountain range Top mountain Minimum height of the reference level (m) European Mittelgebirge (low mountain ranges) Brocken (Germany) 1500 Eastern Alps Gro\u00dfglockner (Austria) 5000 Western Alps Mont Blanc (Italy/France) 6000 Andes Aconcagua (Argentina) 7000 Himalayas Everest (Nepal/China) 8000 Note that to avoid numerical/theoretical problems (namely, local outliers in the calculated gravity), the stations should neither be located inside a model body nor precisely on its edges or surfaces (hence, check the \\(Z\\) values with respect to the top of the uppermost model body). In case of doubt, add \\(13\\) cm to the height of the body surface -- the height of the gravimeter measuring system (see Fig. 4.2 ). The spatial coverage and spacing of the stations (i.e. their \\(XY\\) coordinates), together with the wavelengths of the associated observed anomalies, provide limits to the scales and resolution of subsurface density heterogeneities that can be derived -- an important aspect when planning a gravity modelling project ( Fig. 2.4(b,c,d) ). In the context of resolution, IGMAS+ allows gravity calculations for a large number of stations -- but user should keep in mind the memory size limit (refer to the {{% staticref \"files/IGMAS_User_Manual.pdf\" %}} IGMAS+ User Manual {{% /staticref %}}, chapter 2.1.2). In general, there are two different types of station data that IGMAS+ users may use: irregularly or regularly spaced data. When working with original irregularly spaced measurements (i.e. scattered and clustered \\(XY\\) station coordinates), the observed and the modelled gravity have the same relative position with respect to the causative density bodies. If one chooses to interpret anomalies that have been transferred to a regular grid (e.g., by use of ICGEM data sets, chapter 4.6 , or other grids), however, one accepts that the model bodies have a smaller effect with respect to the stations than the real bodies due to interpolation procedures. Hence, it is generally recommended to use irregularly distributed stations instead of gridded gravity data.","title":"2.3 Model stations"}]}
